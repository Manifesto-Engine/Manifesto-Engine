📜 Manifesto Engine
The Semantic Layer for Deterministic State & AI Governance
Manifesto Engine is a declarative framework designed to solve the "black box" problem in AI-driven systems. By enforcing a strict semantic layer over state transitions, it ensures that every action is deterministic, auditable, and aligned with governed intent.

🚀 The Core Philosophy
Modern AI systems often suffer from non-deterministic "drift." The Manifesto Engine acts as the source of truth, ensuring that logic remains:

Immutable: State transitions are recorded and verifiable.

Declarative: Define what the system should do, not just how.

Governed: Built-in protocols for AI alignment and safety gates.

🛠 Features
Deterministic State Machine: Predictable outcomes across any environment.

Semantic Layering: Bridges high-level intent with low-level execution logic.

Repair-First Architecture: Designed to work with "code printers" and automated repair tools.

Governance Hooks: Native support for AI policy enforcement at the state level.

📦 Installation
Bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Silthix253/manifesto-engine.git

# Install dependencies
cd manifesto-engine
npm install
⌨️ Quick Start
JavaScript
import { Manifesto } from 'manifesto-engine';

const engine = new Manifesto({
  governance: "strict",
  state: "initial"
});

// Define a deterministic transition
engine.transition('update', (state) => {
  return { ...state, status: 'validated' };
});
