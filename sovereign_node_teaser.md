# **The Sovereign Node Manifesto (Teaser)**

## Vision
In an era of centralized surveillance and algorithmic curation, true autonomy requires absolute control over one’s infrastructure. The Sovereign Node represents the culmination of digital independence—a localized, impenetrable fortress of computation. 

## Core Principles (Excerpt)
*   **Cryptographic Autonomy:** Your keys, your data, your rules. No third-party arbitration.
*   **Zero-Trust Default:** Every incoming connection is hostile until cryptographically verified.
*   **Decentralized Resilience:** A network of independent nodes eliminates single points of failure.

*Upgrade to the Premium Sovereign Node Manifesto for the complete operational Commitments, advanced Risk Mitigation strategies, and architectural blueprints for true digital independence.*
